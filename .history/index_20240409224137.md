## Intro
I want to say first of all **I am definitely not an experienced coder by any means**, but the thing I want to do the most is try and improve throughout this class.

I am Ryan Chon, a third year, fresh CE Major at ERC (switched from EE not too long ago).

My goals I set out this year are pretty generic
1. stop being lazy for now
2. Try to find something I really enjoy
3. make some good money

as for my progress
- [ ] stop being lazy for now
- [x] Try to find something I really enjoy
- [ ] make some good money



## Experience 
I still have a lot of bad habits from when I first started and wasn't tested
Like I would write things Like

`for(int i = 0; i > 10 ; i++) {}`

which kind of shows my bad style, but am trying to change.

I haven't done too much on my own (bad) which is why I see this class as a great place to start.

I wish to 
* learn how to work with others
* standardize the work process for myself
* catch a glimpse of what a developing process could be
